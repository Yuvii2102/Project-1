                                          🎲 Student Management System (Java)
                                                                         
A menu-driven Student Management System built using Java that helps manage student academic records efficiently.
This project demonstrates core Java concepts, Object-Oriented Programming, and real-world problem solving, making it ideal for college projects and placement preparation.


                                               🚀 Project Overview

 The Student Management System allows users to:

*  Add student details

*  View student records

*  Automatically calculate grades

*  Manage student data using a structured approach


The application runs in the console and uses ArrayList to store student information dynamically during runtime.
